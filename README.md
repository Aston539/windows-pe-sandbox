**Overview**

The Windows PE Sandbox project leverages vectored exception handling (VEH) to provide a controlled environment for single-stepping through Portable Executable (PE) files. This sandbox allows for detailed analysis and debugging of PE files by intercepting and handling exceptions, offering insights into the execution flow and behavior of the executable.
